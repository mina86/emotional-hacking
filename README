SMBC’s ‘Emotional Hacking’ comic strip

This is a modification of the Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal’s
[‘Emotional Hacking’](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=4088)
comic strip created by Zach Weinersmith.

It rearranges panels of the strip to create less elongated image which
is more printer-friendly.
